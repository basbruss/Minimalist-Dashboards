This repo functions as a showcase of the [Minimalist](https://github.com/UI-Lovelace-Minimalist/UI) themed dashboards I am currently using. Feel free to take some inspiration from it to design your own Minimalist dashboards!

## Web Dashboard (Sidebar)

This dashboard is designed to show on PC's and Tablets. It makes use of the ["Sidebar View"](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/sidebar/) style lovelace dashboard.

## Mobile Dashboard

This dashboard is designed to view on mobile devices.
