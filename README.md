This repo functions as a showcase of the [Minimalist](https://github.com/UI-Lovelace-Minimalist/UI) themed dashboards I am currently using. Feel free to take some inspiration from it to design your own Minimalist dashboards!

## [Adaptive Dashboard](https://ui-lovelace-minimalist.github.io/UI/setup/adaptive_dash/)

This dashboard is designed to view on all sort of devices.

## File system

I am using a so called "split config". This allows me to put each tab in it's own YAML-file. And it allows me to re-use parts which are included in multiple tabs without copying large amounts of code. 

To take this approach even further I have also introduced YAML-anchors to my files.
